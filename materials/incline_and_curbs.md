# incline and curbs

> Question is if we should also try to target inclined streets and the curbs

**Incline:** answer is **“highly likely”**

*Disclaimer: should be possible on the road segments, that are straight and the movement is continuous for let’s say at least 5 seconds. Currently I think it won’t work stationary, or when the rider is maneuvering.*

**Curb:** answer is **“without images - unlikely"**

*Disclaimer: while we can see some drastic acceleration jumps in the data, we can’t confirm for sure what have caused it. Scooters probably don’t cross curbs heads-on - riders use ramps, so curb itself is kind of not directly “under the wheels” of the rider, so the information about the curb is likely not in the data, in any form or shape. If we will decide to include photos and AI (which for PoC we decided to mostly ignore), we may be able to do that (I’ve shown one way to do that in our first meeting).*

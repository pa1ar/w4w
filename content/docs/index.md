# Welcome to Wheels4Wheels

Wheels4Wheels is a comprehensive research project focused on mapping wheelchair accessibility through innovative data collection and analysis methods. Our goal is to create detailed, actionable insights that help build more inclusive communities worldwide.

## Our Mission

We believe that everyone deserves access to safe, navigable routes. By combining advanced data analysis techniques with community-driven research, we're building the foundation for a more accessible worldâ€”one route at a time.

## Getting Started

New to Wheels4Wheels? Here's how to dive in:

### For Data Analysts
Start with our [Surface Smoothness Analysis](/docs/Surface_Smoothness_Analysis) methodology for understanding road conditions through accelerometer data.

### For Researchers
Explore our [Photo-Telemetry File Correlation](/docs/Photo-Telemetry_File_Correlation) guide to understand how we correlate visual data with telemetry information.

### For Contributors
Learn about [OpenStreetMap Editors](/docs/OpenStreetMap_Editors) and how you can contribute to mapping accessibility attributes in your community.

## Research Areas

Our documentation covers several key research areas:

### Data Analysis & Methodology
- **[Surface Smoothness Analysis](/docs/Surface_Smoothness_Analysis)** - Z-axis accelerometer data analysis for accessibility assessment
- **[Incline and Curbs](/docs/incline_and_curbs)** - Understanding terrain challenges
- **[Photo-Telemetry File Correlation](/docs/Photo-Telemetry_File_Correlation)** - Matching visual data with sensor readings

### OpenStreetMap Integration
- **[Attributes on OpenStreetMaps](/docs/Attributes_on_OpenStreetMaps)** - Key attributes for wheelchair accessibility mapping
- **[OpenStreetMap Editors](/docs/OpenStreetMap_Editors)** - Tools and applications for editing accessibility data

### Community & Collaboration
- **[Contribute](/docs/contribute)** - How to get involved and contribute to the project

## Technical Overview

Our research combines multiple data sources:

- **Visual Documentation**: Photo capture of actual road conditions
- **Sensor Data**: Accelerometer and GPS telemetry from mobility devices
- **OpenStreetMap**: Community-driven mapping platform for accessibility attributes
- **Surface Analysis**: Advanced algorithms for road condition assessment

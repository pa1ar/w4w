## Getting Started

This documentation covers various aspects of wheelchair accessibility mapping:

- **Data Collection**: Methods for gathering accessibility information
- **Analysis Techniques**: Tools and algorithms for processing accessibility data
- **Visualization**: Creating interactive maps and visual representations
- **Community Engagement**: Involving volunteers and local communities

## Methodology

Our research combines multiple approaches:

1. **OpenStreetMap Integration**: Leveraging existing crowd-sourced mapping data
2. **Surface Analysis**: Using advanced algorithms to analyze terrain smoothness
3. **Photo-Telemetry Correlation**: Combining visual and sensor data for comprehensive insights
4. **Community Collaboration**: Engaging volunteers and local communities in data collection

## Impact

The Wheels4Wheels project aims to:

- Create comprehensive accessibility maps for communities worldwide
- Provide data-driven insights for urban planning and infrastructure development
- Empower wheelchair users with better navigation tools
- Foster inclusive design in public spaces
